                <i>The Ocean Cleanup</i> is a nonprofit engineering environmental organization based in the Netherlands,
                founded in
                2013 by Boyan Slat, a Dutch-born inventor-entrepreneur of Croatian and Dutch origin who serves as its
                CEO.
                It develops technology to extract plastic pollution from the oceans and intercept it in rivers before it
                can
                reach the ocean. The organization conducts scientific research into oceanic plastic pollution. It has
                conducted two expeditions to the North Pacific Gyre, the Mega Expedition and the Aerial Expedition, and
                continues to publish scientific papers.

                <h2>Marine Plastic Debris</h2>
                <p>
                    It is estimated that there is a stock of 86 million tons of plastic marine debris in the worldwide
                    ocean as of the
                    end of 2013, assuming that 1.4% of global plastics produced from 1950 to 2013 has entered the ocean
                    and has
                    accumulated there. 8.8 million metric tons of plastic waste are dumped in the world's oceans each
                    year. Asia was the
                    leading source of mismanaged plastic waste, with China alone accounting for 2.4 million metric tons.
                    In 2017 the UN
                    estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans, if substantial measures
                    are not taken.

                <p>
                    Plastic waste has reached all the world's oceans. However, it has been found that plastic debris
                    concentrates in the
                    oceanic gyres where it forms extensive garbage patches. Of those, the North Pacific garbage patch is
                    the biggest,
                    with an estimated area of 1.6 million square kilometers. Plastic accumulating in these patches
                    photodegrades into
                    smaller and smaller particles and releases toxic and endocrine chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plastic pollution harms an estimated 100,000 sea turtles and marine mammals and 1,000,000 sea
                    creatures each year.
                    Larger plastics (called "macroplastics") such as plastic shopping bags can clog the digestive tracts
                    of larger
                    animals
                    when consumed by them and can cause starvation through restricting the movement of food, or by
                    filling the stomach
                    and
                    tricking the animal into thinking it is full. Microplastics on the other hand harm smaller marine
                    life. For example,
                    pelagic plastic pieces in the center of our oceanâ€™s gyres outnumber live marine plankton, and are
                    passed up the food
                    chain to reach all marine life as well as human consumers.

                <p>
                    In 2011, aged 16, Dutch Boyan Slat came across more plastic than fish while diving in Greece. He
                    decided to devote a
                    high school project for deeper investigation into ocean plastic pollution and why it was considered
                    impossible to
                    clean up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slat discontinued his aerospace engineering studies at TU Delft to devote his time to developing his
                    idea. He
                    founded The Ocean Cleanup in 2013. The group's mission is to develop advanced technologies to rid
                    the world's oceans
                    of plastic. In June 2014, the Ocean Cleanup published a 528-page feasibility study about the
                    project's potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Ocean Cleanup is mainly funded by donations and sponsors. As of November 2019 it has made a
                    little over $35
                    million from sponsors including Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, philanthropist Peter Thiel,
                    Julius Baer
                    Foundation and Royal DSM. The Ocean Cleanup raised over $2 million with the help of a crowdfunding
                    campaign in 2014.

                    The filtering system uses passive floating structures localized in the ocean gyres. These structures
                    act as a
                    containment boom. The floater drifts with the wind, waves and ocean currents to capture marine
                    debris. A permeable
                    screen underneath the float catches subsurface debris. The system is unmanned and incorporates
                    solar-powered
                    monitoring and navigation systems, including GPS, cameras, lanterns and an automatic identification
                    system (AIS) for
                    vessel traffic services.

                <p>
                    <i>System 001</i>, deployed in September 2018, consisted of a 800 meters long barrier with a 3 meters wide
                    skirt that hangs beneath it. System 001 encountered difficulties retaining the plastic collected.
                    After two month of operation, during which the system had collected 2,000 kilograms of plastic,
                    mechanical stress caused an 18-meter section of the structure to detach. After several months of
                    root cause analysis and redesign, the organization employed System 001/B which could successfully
                    capture and collect plastic, and even microplastics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of July 2021, the organization revisited the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to trial <i>System
                        002</i> -- a revamped version of the previous systems with an increased span of 1,600 metres. The new
                    technology claims to capture 1,000 kg of plastics per day. As of 25 July 2022, The Ocean Cleanup
                    announced to have removed a total of 100,000 kg of plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The organization is now developing <i>System 003</i>, which is planned to have a three times bigger plastic
                    intake than the current design. Unlike the previous prototypes, this new system is meant to be a
                    blueprint for an entire fleet of filtering systems able to meet the scale of the problem.

                    Responding to criticism that filtering devices closer to shore are easier to maintain, and likely to
                    recover more
                    plastic per dollar spent, the organization introduced an additional technology in October 2019 --
                    the River
                    Interpector. Solar-powered Interceptor vessels use floating arms to direct floating waste into the
                    collection
                    conveyor, which dumps trash into dumpsters on a detachable barge below. When full, the collection
                    stops until the
                    barge is removed, emptied and returned to the Interceptor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of October 2022, The Ocean Cleanup enterntains eight Interceptors in Indonesia, Malaysia, Viet
                    Nam, Dominican
                    Republic, USA and Jamaica.

                    In October 2020, The Ocean Cleanup launched their first product made from plastic collected from the
                    Great Pacific
                    Garbage Patch, <i>The Ocean Cleanup Sunglasses</i>. The organization worked with DNV GL to develop a

                    plastic from water sources and the sunglasses were certified to originate from the GPGP. Revenue
                    from the sale of
                    recycling products go into their continued cleanup projects.
